# Programming with C!

Welcome to this brief explanation on programming with C! In this guide, we'll cover some of the most important concepts in C programming, including variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops.

## Variables
Variables are used in C to store data that can be used throughout a program. In C, variables are declared using a data type and a name. Here's an example:

## If Statements
If statements are used in C to make decisions based on a condition. Here's an example:


## Else Statements
Else statements are used in C to provide an alternative path if the condition in an if statement is not met. Here's an example:

## While Loops
While loops are used in C to repeat a block of code while a condition is true. Here's an example:

That's it for this brief explanation of programming with C! These concepts are just the beginning of what you can do with C, and there's a lot more to learn if you're interested in exploring this powerful programming language further.
